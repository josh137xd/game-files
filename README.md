"# game-files was inspired by the classic snake game and was designed to be easier to debug than my first attempt at a Dino Chrome-like game. 
While working on "game files,"(dino like game) I encountered a major issue with the display: when the game was displayed in different sizes, 
the images would move but the hit markers would not. As a result, 
I decided to switch to a project that was easier to debug and that utilized CSS grid elements. 
The controls for this game are simple: use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the player character. 
The game is over when the player hits out of bounds or their own character.
a thing i would like to work on would be a score either timed based or every time the snakes intakes food.
If you experience any issues or have any questions about the game, please let me know."
